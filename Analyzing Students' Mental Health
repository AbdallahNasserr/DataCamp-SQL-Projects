# Analyzing Students' Mental Health

## Introduction

In this project, we will explore and analyze data related to the mental health of international students. Specifically, we aim to understand how the length of stay impacts the mental health of international students. We will perform various calculations, filter records, perform grouped aggregations, and order the results to gain insights into the relationship between the length of stay and mental health indicators.

## Project Steps

### 1. Performing the Calculations

We will start by calculating summary statistics for each diagnostic test using aggregate functions. We will round the averages to two decimal places and use the aliases `min_phq`, `max_phq`, and `avg_phq`.

### 2. Filtering Records

Next, we will explore the data for each student type in `inter_dom` and filter for records related to international students. This step will help us focus our analysis on international students specifically.

### 3. Performing Grouped Aggregations

We will then calculate the count and averages for each length of stay. This will involve grouping the data by the length of stay and aggregating the count as well as the average scores for different mental health indicators (e.g., PHQ, SCS, AS).

### 4. Ordering Records

Finally, we will order the resulting table in descending order of stay. This will allow us to easily observe any patterns or trends in mental health indicators based on the length of stay.

## Project Output

Our final output will be a table with nine observations and five columns summarizing data for international students. The columns will include:
- `stay`: Length of stay
- `count_int`: Number of international students for each length of stay
- `average_phq`: Average PHQ score for each length of stay
- `average_scs`: Average SCS score for each length of stay
- `average_as`: Average AS score for each length of stay

The averages will be rounded to two decimal places for better readability. The table will be sorted in descending order of stay to highlight any potential trends or patterns.

By following these steps, we will gain valuable insights into the mental health of international students and understand the impact of their length of stay on various mental health indicators.
